# PySpark
It is very important to determine key factors that influences a passenger satisfaction for a given airline. Overall customer satisfaction plays an important part in affecting the business of an airline company. Hence it is quite important to analyse and improve factors that are closely related to customer satisfaction. 
For my research I use Pyspark which is an interface for Apache Spark in Python. Pyspark allows you to write Spark applications using various Python APIâ€™s and also provides the PySpark shell for data analysis in a distributed environment. Pyspark supports a number of Sparks features like Spark SQL, DataFrame, Streaming, MLib which is Machine Learning and Spark Core.
